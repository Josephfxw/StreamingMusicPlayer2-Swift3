## Introduction 
The objecive of this music player is to help new church members who are taking RCIA class to get access to Christian hymns. The front-end of this app is implemented in Swift, the backend of the app is supported by php programming. There are two phases of this app development: phase one is to meet the requirment for users to be able to play and download hymns, phase two will track the number of plays and likes for a specific song in the database. I have already finished the first phase. 


## Requirements

* An iPhone/iPad running iOS 8.0+
